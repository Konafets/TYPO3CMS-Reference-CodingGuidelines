Extension directory structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An extension directory contains the following files and directories:


.. ### BEGIN~OF~TABLE ###

.. container:: table-row

   Name
         Name

   Description
         Description


.. container:: table-row

   Name
         :code:`ext\_emconf.php`

   Description
         This is the only mandatory file in the extension. It describes
         the extension for the rest of TYPO3.


.. container:: table-row

   Name
         :code:`ext\_icon.gif`

   Description
         This is the icon of the extension. The filename may not be changed.


.. container:: table-row

   Name
         :code:`ext\_localconf.php`

   Description
         This file contains hook definitions and plugin configuration. It must
         not contain a PHP encoding declaration. The filename may not be
         changed.


.. container:: table-row

   Name
         :code:`ext\_tables.php`

   Description
         This file contains table declarations. It must not contain a PHP
         encoding declaration. For more information about table declarations
         and definitions see the "TYPO3 Core API" document. The filename may
         not be changed.


.. container:: table-row

   Name
         :code:`ext\_tables.sql`

   Description
         This files contains SQL definitions for extension tables. The filename
         may not be changed.

         The file may contain either a full table definition or a partial
         table. The full table definition declares extension's tables. It looks
         like a normal SQL :code:`CREATE TABLE` statement.

         The partial table definition contains a list of the fields that will
         be added to an existing table. Here is an example::

            CREATE TABLE pages (
                   tx_myext_field int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
            );

         Notice the comma after the field. In the full table definition it will
         be an error, but in the partial table definition it is required. TYPO3
         will merge this table definition to the existing table definition when
         comparing expected and actual table definitions. Partial definitions
         can also contain indexes and other directives. They can also change
         existing table fields though that is not recommended, because it may
         create problems with the TYPO3 core and/or other extensions.

         TYPO3 parses :code:`ext\_tables.sql` files. TYPO3 expects that all
         table definitions in this file look like the ones produced by the
         :code:`mysqldump` utility. Incorrect definitions may not be recognized
         by the TYPO3 SQL parser or may lead to MySQL errors, when TYPO3 tries
         to apply them.


.. container:: table-row

   Name
         :code:`tca.php`

   Description
         This file contains full table definitions for extension tables.


.. container:: table-row

   Name
         :code:`locallang\*.xlf`

   Description
         These files contain localizable labels in standard XLIFF format, one
         language per file. They can also appear in subdirectories.


.. container:: table-row

   Name
         :code:`locallang\*.xml`

   Description
         These files contain localizable labels in a custom XML based format,
         possibly multiple languages per file. They can also appear in
         subdirectories. Deprecated since TYPO3 4.6; use
         :code:`locallang\*.xlf` files instead.


.. container:: table-row

   Name
         :code:`doc/`

   Description
         This directory contains the extension manual. The filename may not
         be changed.


.. container:: table-row

   Name
         :code:`doc/manual.sxw`

   Description
         This file contains the extension manual in OpenOffice 1.0 format. The
         name or format of the file may not be changed. See the extension
         "doc_template" ("Documentation template") on typo3.org for more
         information about extension manuals.


.. container:: table-row

   Name
         :code:`piX/`

   Description
         These directories contain Frontend plugins. If an extension is generated
         by the extension :code:`kickstarter`, :code:`*X*` will be a number. It is
         recommended to give more meaningful names to Frontend plugin directories.


.. container:: table-row

   Name
         :code:`svX/`

   Description
         These directories contain TYPO3 services. If an extension is generated by
         the extension :code:`kickstarter`, :code:`*X*` will be a number. It is
         recommended to give more meaningful names to service directories.


.. container:: table-row

   Name
         :code:`modX/`

   Description
         These directories commonly contain Backend modules. If an extension is
         generated by the :code:`kickstarter`, :code:`*X*` will be substituted
         with a number. It is recommended to give more meaningful names to Backend
         module directories.


.. container:: table-row

   Name
         :code:`modfuncX/`

   Description
         These directories commonly contain Backend submodules (embedded into
         other modules). If an extension is generated by the :code:`kickstarter`,
         :code:`*X*` will be a number. It is recommended to give more
         meaningful names to these directories.


.. container:: table-row

   Name
         :code:`lib/`

   Description
         Directory for non–TYPO3 files supplied with the extension. TYPO3 is
         licensed under GPL version or 2 or any later version. Any non–TYPO3
         code must be compatible with GPL version 2 or any later version. Note:
         this name is not mandatory, but recommended.


.. ###### END~OF~TABLE ######


This directory structure is **strongly recommended**.
Extensions may create their own directories (for example, move all
language files into other directories).
