TYPO3 files and user files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All files in the TYPO3 web site directory hierarchy are divided to
TYPO3 files and user files. TYPO3 files are files that come with the
TYPO3 source package released by the TYPO3 core team. This includes
files inside t3lib/and typo3/directories and the file named
index.phpin the root of TYPO3 installation

All other files are user files. This includes extensions, files in the
fileadmin/directory or files generated by TYPO3 (like thumbnails or
temporary CSS files).
