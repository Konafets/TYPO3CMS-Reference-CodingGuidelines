Accessing the database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The TYPO3 database should be always accessed through the use of
$GLOBALS['TYPO3\_DB']. This is the instance of t3lib\_dbclass from
t3lib/class.t3lib\_db.php.

The same rule applies for accessing non-TYPO3 databases: they should
be accessed by using a different instance of the same class. Failing
this condition may corrupt TYPO3 database or prevent access to TYPO3
database for the rest of the script.
