About this document
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This document defines coding guidelines for the TYPO3 v4 project.
Following these guidelines is mandatory for TYPO3 core developers and
contributors to the TYPO3 core.

Extension authors are strongly encouraged to follow these guidelines
when developing extensions for TYPO3. Following these guidelines makes
it easier to read the code, analyze it for learning or perform code
reviews. These guidelines also help to prevent typical errors in the
TYPO3 code.

This document defines how TYPO3 code, files and directories should be
structured and formatted. It does not teach how to program for TYPO3
and does not provide technical information about TYPO3.

Page numbers in this document refer to its printable version
