What's new
^^^^^^^^^^

This version of the CGLs mostly contains more complete and precise
information about already existing guidelines. It is updated to TYPO3
4.6.

Furthermore the appendix which described how to properly set up
various IDEs for working with the TYPO3 v4 Core has been moved to the
wiki: http://wiki.typo3.org/PHP\_Editors\_/\_IDE\_for\_TYPO3
