The CGL as a means of quality assurance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our programmers know the CGL and are encouraged to inform authors,
should their code not comply with the guidelines.

Apart from that, adhering to the CGL is not voluntary; the CGL are also
enforced by structural means: Automated tests are run by the continuous
integration tool Jenkins to make sure that every code change complies
with the CGL. In case a change does not meet the criteria, Jenkins will
give a negative vote in the review system and point to the according
problem.
